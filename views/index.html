Check it out <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_izwjulQ03w' target='_blank'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGbURNz_C3c' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">I have been the first hire/only employee at two different companies in the past, handling ALL customer service and support. I have the experience, and the ambition to help make your customer success team a success of its own.</p>
                <p>--</p>
                <p class="text-muted">A time I had to tell the customer 'no', happened quite fequently at my previous company, Bowtie.io. We were a SaaS product and one developer asked us to integrate with Angular. We quickly heard his request, and decided it wasn't worth the time or effort to try and give him a customized Angular integration with the resources we had at the time. This was particularly difficult because an associate told him it was possible, but the engineering team had to counter that claim. It is hard to tell a customer 'no' especially after they have heard yes, but if you offer to help them move forward a different way, it can be a successful interaction.</p>
                <p>--</p>
                <p class="text-muted">I believe that customer should always think they are right. Whether they are actually right, or if that's not the case, it doesn't matter. They need to feel like they are being heard and taken care of, because that's what brings repeat business and forms relationships.</p>

            <p>We don't offer live image previews - yet! That feature is currently being perfected and will be available for all of our users shortly. In the meantime, you can use Product Customizer to allow this functionality. If you still need help with that, <a href="http://help.shopstorm.com/article/379-show-uploaded-images-in-the-cart">we've written docs to help you.</a> Once we implement this feature, we will be sure to spread the word so that you can take full advantage. Unlike some resources out there, our support team is here to help you with questions you have related to anything ShopStorm, so I encourage you to take advantage of our awesome customer success team whenever you need us!</p>

          <h4>Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</h4>
            <p>First, I would find the problem. Debugging is a huge component to customer success positions, and any position at a technology company. Once you find the source of the problem, either take steps and action to fix it, if it's in your wheelhouse, or notify the team who is responsible for the fix. Once you and your team are on the same page about what's going wrong and the steps that are going to be taken to fix it, I would send a follow up email to every customer telling them we have found the source of the issue and are already working on a fix. Sending a mass email may alert unaware csutomers of the issue, but taking the time to respond to a lengthy inbox of distraught customers may be time consuming. Also this shows the other half of our user base that we are responsive and take all bugs seriously. Communicating with them once a solution path is in place is key, so that they know things are already being handled and it appears to them that we are opening clear lines of communication.</p>

          <h4>We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase.</h4>
            <p>The last thing I bought online was a duvet cover. The steps I took to complete this purchase were: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set a personal budget of $150.</li>
              <li>Navigated to bedbathandbeyond.com</li>
              <li>Selected 'bedding' from Products drop down menu on the left hand side of the screen</li>
              <li>Selected duvet covers from the Categories list on the left hand side of the screen</li>
              <li>Selected King size and grey color from the Narrow your Search menu on the left navbar, and began browsing.</li>
              <li>I read reviews of each comforter that I liked the asthetics of, and gauged interest I had in each fabric that was not linen.</li>
              <li>Finally, I selected te duvet cover I liked the most that was within my $150 budget, selected the size and color, and hit 'Add to cart'. From there I followed all navigational and instrcutional steps set up by Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I had previously purchased a duvet cover from Bed Bath and Beyond, and it was made out of linen. I quickly knew this type of fabric was not going to work for me, so this purchase was heavily influenced by the need for something that was not linen. I completed my purchase online because it was easier than going to the store to shop, and provided real time reviews on each product.</p>
